# Unity-Arduino Cereal Conversations

In this repository we use the [Cereal-IO library](https://github.com/bernatGene/cereal-io) to communicate Unity and Arduino. 
The library uses the serial communication protocol in a friendly manner.

In this repository you will find examples by Lina Bautista and Citlali Hernández, 
for our Playful Interaction classes at Elisava, School of Design & Engineering, 2025.
